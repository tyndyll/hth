# Kivy App

This was an initial foray into creating this app as an actual Kivy application. It had to be abandoned shortly after starting because it wasn't possible to do the voice communication we wanted

These files remain as a reminder of what could have been, but also to develop further for those that perhaps do not want to use the WebRTC functionality and would prefer to deploy in this matter.

TL;DR Kivy app, will definitely get back to it
