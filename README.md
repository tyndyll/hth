# hth

hth (Here To Help) is a web based interface originally designed for use to provide information for homeless and at risk peoples. It was created as part of the [Code for Better Hack](http://totalmobile.co.uk/latest/events/event/2015-04-11-night-at-the-museum-hack) organised by [TotalMobile](http://totalmobile.co.uk/). hth is designed with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) in mind, so that client machines can be deployed cheaply where they are needed. 

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind the project is that despite more and more information on shelter, food and health available online, accessing the Internet is not always easy due to cost, lack of equipment or facilities. By providing the information on low cost hardware that can be placed in accessible locations, those that need information now can get it. At the top level 3 categories are presented, clicking giving more and more granular information.

## Features

* All information and images are editable by the admin
* Ability to use WebRTC to call provided numbers
* Can switch easily between languages

## Installation

*TODO*

## Future Development

* Enable sync with the server so client instances can present information statically
* Create a Docker Image for simplified installation
* Create an installable Debian Package
* Create a dedicated Raspberry Pi image
